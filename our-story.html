  Salmon cookies are cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Invented by Pat and her husband, Jeff. Seen below with their two kids, Eric and Sarah.
